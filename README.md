# Steering-Library
The objective of this lab project is to create a small “steering library” on Unreal.

# Project Status
This project is currently in development. Some behaviors may not yet be fully implemented or functional.  
Future updates will include refinements, optimizations, and additional features.

# Overview
This project is a small steering library implemented in Unreal Engine. It provides various AI movement behaviors inspired by Craig Reynolds' steering behaviors. The objective is to visualize and simulate autonomous agents moving in a dynamic environment.
⚠️ This project is still in development, and not all behaviors are fully implemented yet.

# Features
The library aims to include the following behaviors (Work in Progress 🚧):

## Basic Behaviors:
  - 🚧 Seek: The agent moves toward a fixed target. (First Version)
  - ❌ Flee: The agent moves away from a fixed target. (Not yet implemented)
  - ❌ Pursuit: The agent predicts and intercepts a moving target.  (Not yet implemented)
  - ❌ Evade: The agent predicts and avoids a pursuer. (Not yet implemented)
  - ❌ Arrival: The agent moves toward a fixed target and decelerates to stop smoothly. (Not yet implemented)

## Combined Behaviors:
  - ❌ Circuit: The agent follows a looping path continuously. (Not yet implemented)
  - ❌ One way: The agent follows a path to a specific endpoint and stops. (Not yet implemented)
  - ❌ Two ways: The agent moves to an endpoint, then reverses direction back to the start, repeating the process indefinitely. (Not yet implemented)
